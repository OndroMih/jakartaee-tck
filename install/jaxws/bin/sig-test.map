# The signature test mapping file for the JAX-WS TCK.  This file
# should be formatted as a standard java properties file.  The
# name is the package name and the value is the version of the
# package that should be tested by the signature tests.
#
# The resultant signature file name has a name that complies
# with the following format:
# <package>.sig
# Given this format, the following example breaks down as follows:
#    jakarta.xml.jaxws.sig:
#      <package> = jakarta.xml.ws
#      <technology_version> = 2.2  (for JAX-WS)
